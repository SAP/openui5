	 * 		OData) it is the name of the property that has nested properties
	 * @property {string} [label] - If metadata has label information, it should be provided. A fallback to the
	 * 		technical name is implemented in the tooling and doesn't need to be provided by delegates
	 * @property {string} [tooltip] - If metadata has tooltip information (e.g. <code>quickinfo</code> annotation in OData),
	 * 		it should be provided. A fallback to the label or technical name is implemented in the tooling and
	 * 		doesn't need to be provided by delegates
	 * @property {string} bindingPath - Relative binding path, starting from the current binding context. Usually the
	 * 		same as the name, but for nested properties (e.g. complex properties or navigation properties) it has
	 * 		segments
	 * @property {boolean} [unsupported] - The delegate has to return all properties that could be bound somewhere.
	 * 		However some properties maybe shouldn't appear in the dialog (e.g. based on <code>UI.Hidden</code> annotation,
	 * 		properties you would name in the <code>filter</code> attribute of <code>SmartForm</code>s or properties
	 * 		that are unsupported by the delegate's create methods). These properties should be marked as <code>unsupported</code>.
	 * @property {string} [entityType] - Only needed for OData-based delegates to help custom field support tooling
	 * @property {sap.ui.fl.interfaces.delegate.PropertyInfo[]} [properties] - Some properties can be nested (e.g.
	 * 		based on complex types and navigation properties in OData). In this case the delegate can provide these
	 * 		nested properties. However currently only nesting of one level is supported by adaptation dialogs.
