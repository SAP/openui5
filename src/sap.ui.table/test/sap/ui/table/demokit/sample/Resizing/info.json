When mode 'Fixed' is used (default) the table shows as many rows as defined in the property 'visibleRowCount'. In mode 'Auto' the value of the 'visibleRowCount' property is changed by the table automatically. The table will adjust its maximum row count to the space it is allowed to cover limited by the surrounding container (Note: The surrounding container MUST provide a defined height. Otherwise this feature cannot be used.). The minimum row count is defined by property 'minAutoRowCount'. In interactive mode the user can change the visibleRowCount via a resizer bar. The segmented button on the bottom can be used to swicth between the different modes (The table in the example initially has set a visible row count of 7 and a minimum row count of 5)."
