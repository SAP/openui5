TIT_WHATS_NEW_RENAME_REWORK_TITLE=Rename Rework
TXT_WHATS_NEW_DIALOG_RENAME_REWORK_DESCRIPTION=We have made some changes to the rename functionality in UI Adaptation.
TXT_WHATS_NEW_DIALOG_RENAME_REWORK_TEXT_1=The process for renaming textual elements has been improved. Each rename action now opens a dialog. Many texts support renaming the underlying property, so changes made this way are visible throughout the application wherever this text appears.
TXT_WHATS_NEW_DIALOG_RENAME_REWORK_TEXT_2=For example, a field might be present in a filter bar as a filter, in the corresponding table as a column, and as a field in the detail page's form control. Renaming one of these entries, e.g., by selecting "Change Labels" in the filter bar, will also affect the column of the table and the form's field.
TXT_WHATS_NEW_DIALOG_RENAME_REWORK_TEXT_3=You can rename fields in a form individually by selecting the "Rename" action. To see the effects of these changes, you need to restart the application. If you make such a change, the toolbar includes a button that restarts the application for you and automatically enters UI adaptation mode.

TIT_WHATS_NEW_TEXT_ARRANGEMENT_TITLE=Change Text Arrangement
TXT_WHATS_NEW_DIALOG_TEXT_ARRANGEMENT_DESCRIPTION=Key users can now change the display behavior of texts that support this feature.
TXT_WHATS_NEW_DIALOG_TEXT_ARRANGEMENT_TEXT_1=Most applications now support changing the text arrangement or display behavior of their fields. FilterBar, most Tables, and Forms include a "Change Text Arrangement" action. This feature lets key users decide if fields should be represented by their ID, their textual representation, or both.
TXT_WHATS_NEW_DIALOG_TEXT_ARRANGEMENT_TEXT_2=This change applies to the underlying property, so you can observe the desired display behavior wherever the property's text is used. It's not just the control used to create this change that's affected.
TXT_WHATS_NEW_DIALOG_TEXT_ARRANGEMENT_TEXT_3=To see the effect of these changes, you need to restart the application. If you create such a change, the toolbar contains a button that restarts the application for you and automatically enters UI adaptation.

TIT_WHATS_NEW_EXTENDED_ACTIONS_TITLE=Extended Actions
TXT_WHATS_NEW_DIALOG_EXTENDED_ACTIONS_DESCRIPTION=Important actions are now presented more centrally.
TXT_WHATS_NEW_DIALOG_EXTENDED_ACTIONS_TEXT_1=Certain actions are of central importance for their respective controls and should also be accessible from their sub-controls.
TXT_WHATS_NEW_DIALOG_EXTENDED_ACTIONS_TEXT_2=When working, for example, with a Table, key users should always be able to access the Table settings directly, even when selecting the toolbar or a column. Such actions will be propagated to the context menu of child controls, so they are always just one click away. On the right side of the menu entry, we show the control that propagated the action.
