	 *  @class Utility class for state handling of MDC controls.
	 *  The <code>StateUtil</code> class is offering a generic way to retrieve states and set a desired state for a given MDC control.
	 *  The <code>StateUtil</code> class is tightly coupled to the SAPUI5 flexibility integration of MDC controls.
	 *  To use the APIs of <code>Stateutil</code>, the given MDC control instance needs to fully enable all available <code>p13nMode</code> options.
	 *  This way, <code>Stateutil</code> can create the required changes and retrieve the relevant state of each control.

		/**
		 *	Creates and applies the necessary changes for a given control and state.
		 *   <b>Note:</b>The changes are created in the same order as the objects are passed into
		 *   the state object attributes. For example, by adding two objects
		 *   into the <code>items</code> attribute of the <code>oState</code> object, the first entry is created,
		 *   and the second entry is created on top of the first change.
		 *   The item state is applied for each provided object in the given order in the array and uses
		 *	the provided position. If no index or only an invalid index has been provided,
		 *   the item is added to the array after the last item in the affected control's </code>item</code> aggregation.
		 *	In addition the following attributes can be used to remove a state:
		 *
		 *	<ul>
		 * 	<li><code>filtered</code> - Set to <code>false</code> in the <code>filter</code> scope on condition level to remove one specific condition for the given key.</li>
		 *	<li><code>sorted</code> - Set to <code>false</code>  in the <code>sorters</code> scope to remove a sorter/code>.</li>
		 *	<li><code>grouped</code> - Set to <code>false</code>  in the <code>groupLevels</code> scope to remove a grouping.</li>
		 *	<li><code>visible</code> - Set to <code>false</code>  to remove an aggregation item.</li>
		 *	<li><code>aggregated</code> - Set to <code>false</code>  to remove an aggregation.</li>
		 *	</ul>
		 *
		 *	<b>Note:</b>To improve the performance, you should avoid additional calls of the controlâ€™s delegate.
		 *	To do this, the <code>propertyInfo</code> property of the relevant control can be enriched with the properties used in the provided state.
