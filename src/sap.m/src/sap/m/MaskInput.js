				 * for digits, has the characters '2' and '0' as immutable).
				 * 2. Adding a rule corresponding to the <code>placeholderSymbol</code> is not recommended and would lead to an unpredictable behavior.

				 * Use the double escape '^^' if you want to make use of the escape character as an immutable one.
