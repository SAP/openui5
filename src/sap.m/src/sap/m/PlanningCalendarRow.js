			 * {@link #event:appointmentDragEnter appointmentDragEnter} event can change the default behavior and allow

			 *
			 * Hours:<br>
			 * For views where the displayed intervals are hours, the placeholder snaps on every interval
			 * of 15 minutes. After the appointment is dropped, the {@link #event:appointmentDrop appointmentDrop} event is fired, containing
			 * the new start and end UI5Date or JavaScript Date objects.<br>
			 * For example, an appointment with start date "Nov 13 2017 12:17:00" and end date "Nov 13 2017 12:45:30"
			 * lasts for 27 minutes and 30 seconds. After dragging and dropping to a new time, the possible new
			 * start date has time that is either "hh:00:00" or "hh:15:00" because of the placeholder that can
			 * snap on every 15 minutes. The new end date is calculated to be 27 minutes and 30 seconds later
			 * and would be either "hh:27:30" or "hh:57:30".
			 *
			 * Days:<br>
			 * For views where intervals are days, the placeholder highlights the whole day and after the
			 * appointment is dropped the {@link #event:appointmentDrop appointmentDrop} event is fired. The event contains the new start and
			 * end UI5Date or JavaScript Date objects with changed date but the original time (hh:mm:ss) is preserved.
			 *
			 * Months:<br>
			 * For views where intervals are months, the placeholder highlights the whole month and after the
			 * appointment is dropped the {@link #event:appointmentDrop appointmentDrop} event is fired. The event contains the new start and
			 * end UI5Date or JavaScript Date objects with changed month but the original date and time is preserved.
			 *
			 * <b>Note:</b> In "One month" view, the appointments are not draggable on small screen (as there they are
			 * displayed as a list below the dates). Group appointments are also not draggable.
			 *
			 * <b>Note:</b> Additional application-level code will be needed to provide a keyboard alternative to drag and drop mouse interactions.
			 * One possible option is by handling {@link sap.m.PlanningCalendar#event:appointmentSelect appointmentSelect} event of the
			 * <code>sap.m.PlanningCalendar</code>, as shown in the following simplified example:
			 *
			 * <pre>
			 * 	new sap.m.PlanningCalendar({
			 * 		...
   			 *		rows: [
      		 *			new sap.m.PlanningCalendarRow({
         	 *				...
         	 *				enableAppointmentsDragAndDrop: true,
			 *         		...
      		 *			}),
      		 *			...
   			 *		],
   			 *		...
   			 *		appointmentSelect: function(event) {
      		 *			// Open edit {@link sap.m.Dialog Dialog} to modify the appointment properties
      		 *			new sap.m.Dialog({ ... }).openBy(event.getParameter("appointment"));
   			 *		}
			 *	});
			 * </pre>
			 *
