			 * snap on every 30 minutes. The new end date is calculated to be 27 minutes and 30 seconds later
			 * and would be either "hh:27:30" or "hh:57:30".
			 *
			 * Days:<br>
			 * For views where intervals are days, the placeholder highlights the whole day and after the
			 * appointment is dropped the {@link #event:appointmentDrop appointmentDrop} event is fired. The event contains the new start and
			 * end JavaScript date objects with changed date but the original time (hh:mm:ss) is preserved.
			 *
			 * Months:<br>
			 * For views where intervals are months, the placeholder highlights the whole month and after the
			 * appointment is dropped the {@link #event:appointmentDrop appointmentDrop} event is fired. The event contains the new start and
			 * end JavaScript date objects with changed month but the original date and time is preserved.
