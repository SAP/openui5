		 *
		 * A {@link sap.m.Slider} element represents a scale with tickmarks and labels.
		 * The purpose of the element is to decouple the scale logic from other controls i.e. Slider / RangeSlider
		 *
		 *
		 * The most important properties of the ResponsiveScale are:
		 * <ul>
		 * <li> tickmarksBetweenLabels - Puts a label on every N-th tickmark.</li>
		 * </ul>

		/**
		 * Computes which tickmarks with labels should get hidden.
		 * Returns a flagged array with the indices of those tickmarks:
		 * <code>[0: undefined, 1: true, 2: undefined, 3: true, 4: undefined, 5: true, 6: undefined]</code>
		 *
		 * The algorithm to determine which labels should get hidden is:
		 * 1) Check if there's enough space for all the labels. Which means that the distance between labels
		 *      should not be less than labels' width. That width is defined in {_CONSTANTS.TICKMARKS.MIN_SIZE.WITH_LABEL}.
		 * 2) Start walking from both edges of the scale to the center and remove every second <b>visible</b> label.
		 * 3) Move the pointer to the next starting visible node and repeat from 1) if there's still not enough space.
		 *
		 * <b>Note:</b> The starting point is always an integer which is on power of 2. For example: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.
		 * The implementation of 2) (the walk step/jump) is also an integer which is on power of 2. For example if we start from position
		 * <b>1</b> (the second element in the array), we'll visit the following nodes: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc.
		 * Then if we move the starting pointer to the next visible node, its index (it's 2) is integer on power of 2,
		 * the jump would become <b>4</b>: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, etc. Remember that we want to remove every second <b>visible<b>
		 * node and 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 are already invisible. So, if we continue in that manner, we'll always move the starting
		 * pointer to the next integer which is on power of 2 and the jump step would be the next integer which is on power of 2.
		 * For example:
		 *
		 * Initial array:          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]

		 * #2: Start: 2, Jump: 4:  [0, X, X, X, 4, X, X, X, 8, X, X,  X,  12, X,  X,  X,  16]
		 * #3: Start: 4, Jump: 8:  [0, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, 8, X, X,  X,  X,  X,  X,  X,  16]
		 * #4: Start: 8, Jump: 16: [0, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X,  X,  X,  X,  X,  X,  16]
