				Keyboard Usage of ARIA Role Mapped Controls

			<h2 id="overview">
				Overview
			</h2>

			<p>
				Mouse users can interact with any visible element on a page directly by clicking on it.
				To interact with an element, keyboard users need to move the focus sequentially through all interactive elements on a page until they reach the desired element.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Navigating through a website with a keyboard uses the <b>TAB</b> key to move forward and the <b>SHIFT+TAB</b> combination to move backwards.
				These keys move you only between elements of the page that are <b>focusable</b>.
				If an element can be focused using the keyboard, then it should be interactive.
				That is, the user should be able to do something to it and produce a change of some kind (for example, activating a link or changing an option).
			</p>

			<h2 id="tabindex">
				Tabindex
			</h2>
			<p>HTML elements like buttons, links, inputs and others, can receive focus.</p>
			<br>
			<button>Press Tab</button>
			<pre class="lang-html">
&lt;button&gt;Press Tab&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
			<br>
			<p>
				Some HTML elements do not receive focus by default. To make such elements focusable, you can use the
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex" target="_blank">tabindex</a> global attribute.
				This attribute indicates that the element can be focused, and where it participates in sequential keyboard navigation (usually with the <b>Tab</b> key, hence the name).
				An example for usage of the tabindex in real scenario is when a custom widget with role combobox needs to be created.
			</p>
			<pre class="lang-html">
&lt;div role="combobox" tabindex="0" ...&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;</pre>
			<br>
			<p>
				When using tabindex with value -1 you can prevent an interactive element
				to be focused. This might be used in specific scenarios.
				For example, it is used in the design of the Input control,
				where the icons container has a tabindex -1 as there are
				other keyboard means how to activate the functionally with
				keyboard and we want to optimize the tab chain.
