				In this application you will understand what web accessibility is and how you can implement it.
				Whether you are a control or application developer,
				or a business user searching to know more about accessibility in the SAPUI5 area, you can find a lot of useful information and links in this app.
			</p>
			<p>
				But first let’s start with the definition of accessibility.
			</p>
			<p>
				Accessibility refers to the possibility for everyone, including and especially people with disabilities, to access and use information technology products.
				SAP has long made this a priority. Making our software work for more people has been and continues to be a high priority.
				All users should be able to operate our software without loss of meaningful content, functionality, and efficiency, by using assistive technologies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Following those principles in an ongoing approach, we at SAPUI5 aim to bring accessibility to life by providing the appropriate accessibility features,
				and following precise accessibility requirements and processes. SAPUI5 is following the SAP ‘s design and development guidelines,
				as well as the testing procedures and accessibility reporting, that are based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 level A and AA.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are heavily invested in accessibility and want to show you how by using the framework you can achieve an accessible application.
			</p>
			<p>
				Accessibility in SAPUI5 is incorporated in two levels: framework and application.
				Many fundamental accessibility features are built into the core design elements upfront and are available out of the box.
			</p>
			<p>
				Enabling accessibility is a complex process and in this application, we will guide you through the most important steps.
