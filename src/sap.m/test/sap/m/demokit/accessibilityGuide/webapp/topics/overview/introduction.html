				What is accessibility?
			</h2>  
			<p>
				Accessibility refers to the possibility for everyone, including and especially people with disabilities, to access and use information technology products.
				All users should be able to operate our software without loss of meaningful content, functionality, and efficiency, by using assistive technologies.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How to provide better accessibility?
			</h2>	 
			<p>
				We are following SAPâ€˜s design and development guidelines, testing procedures, and accessibility reporting, that are based on
				Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 level A and AA, US Section 508, and the EN 301 549 Chapter 9, 10 and 11.
			</p>
			<p>
				Accessibility in SAPUI5 is incorporated in two levels: framework and application.
				We aim to show you how to create a web application using the accessibility features that are already included in the framework and are available out of the box.
				However, enabling accessibility is a complex process and there are many additional steps that should be considered and implemented by the app developers.
				In this application, we will guide you through the most important steps.
