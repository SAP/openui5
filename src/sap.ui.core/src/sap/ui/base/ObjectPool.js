	/**
	 * Creates an ObjectPool instance based on the given oObjectClass.&lt;br/&gt;
	 * If there is a free pooled instance, returns that one, otherwise creates a new one.&lt;br/&gt;
	 * In order to be maintained by the ObjectPool, oObjectClass must implement
	 * methods described in the class description.
	 *
	 * @param {function} oObjectClass constructor for the class of objects that this pool should manage
	 *
	 * @class Manages a pool of objects all of the same type;
	 * the type has to be specified at pool construction time.
	 *
	 * Maintains a list of free objects of the given type.
	 * If {@link sap.ui.base.ObjectPool.prototype.borrowObject} is called, an existing free object
	 * is taken from the pool and the <code>init</code> method is called on this
	 * object.
	 *
	 * When no longer needed, any borrowed object should be returned to
	 * the pool by calling {@link #returnObject}. At that point in time,
	 * the reset method is called on the object and the object is added to the
	 * list of free objects.
	 *
	 * See {@link sap.ui.base.Poolable} for a description of the contract for poolable objects.
	 *
	 * Example:
	 * <pre>
	 *   this.oEventPool = new sap.ui.base.ObjectPool(sap.ui.base.Event);
	 *   var oEvent = this.oEventPool.borrowObject(iEventId, mParameters);
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * @extends sap.ui.base.Object
	 * @author Malte Wedel
	 * @version ${version}
	 * @constructor
	 * @alias sap.ui.base.ObjectPool
	 * @public
