        <p>
          This is the UI5 Test Suite which you can use for testing your UI5 control libraries and application pages.
        </p>

        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <p>
          On the left hand-side, you find the <i>Test Navigation</i> view that shows all test cases detected in the
          current Web application. You can also manually add additional other test-cases by entering the URL for
          these in the provided input field.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the <i>Settings View</i> you can change settings like the theme used for rendering, the render mode or
          right-to-left (a.k.a. RTL) support.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <i>Content View</i> which is the one where this page is displayed, shows the test page that was selected
          in the navigation view.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <i>Trace View</i> at the bottom shows the SAPUI5 framework trace. It displays for instance thrown events
          and other framework details.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the right hand-side, you see the <i>Control Tree</i> view which shows the control tree of the selected
          test page. If you select a node in this tree, the properties of the related control are shown at in the
          <i>Properties</i> view at the bottom right. In this view, you can change properties of the selected control and
          apply them on-the-fly to the test page.
        </p>
