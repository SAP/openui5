		<h1>Manual Integration Test: OData Products App</h1>
		<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
		Test for the sap.ui.model.odata.type.Unit and sap.ui.model.odata.type.Currency types
		<h2>PREPARATION</h2>
		To check console errors, open the developer tools before starting the application and check
		with each step that there are no errors and warnings.

		<h3>Testing with mock data</h3>
		Start the Products application with the following URL (adjust host and port if necessary):
		<ul>
			<li> local: <a href="http://localhost:8080/test-resources/sap/ui/core/demokit/sample/common/index.html?component=odata.v4.Products&amp;sap-ui-language=EN">http://localhost:8080/test-resources/sap/ui/core/demokit/sample/common/index.html?component=odata.v4.Products&amp;sap-ui-language=EN</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Testing with back end</h3>
		Configure your IDE to be able to run the Products application against an ABAP
		back-end system.<br>
		Start the Products application with the URL (adjust host and port if necessary):
		<ul>
			<li> local: <a href="http://localhost:8080/test-resources/sap/ui/core/demokit/sample/common/index.html?component=odata.v4.Products&amp;realOData=true&amp;sap-ui-language=EN">http://localhost:8080/test-resources/sap/ui/core/demokit/sample/common/index.html?component=odata.v4.Products&amp;realOData=true&amp;sap-ui-language=EN</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>REALIZE and CHECK</h2>
		<h3>Check whether measures are handled properly regarding decimal places defined for the
			corresponding unit code</h3>
		<h4>Testing with mock data</h4>
		For testing, you may use the following valid unit codes:
		<ul>
			<li> KG and G (0 decimal places)</li>
			<li> % (0 decimal places)</li>
			<li> DEG (1 decimal places)</li>
			<li> NO (2 decimal places)</li>
			<li> M/L (3 decimal places)</li>
			<li> &mu;G (6 decimal places)</li>
		</ul>
		For a complete list of valid unit codes, see the &quot;ExternalCode&quot; property of the
		objects linked in "Unit Codes" in the test application.
		<h4>Testing with back end</h4>
		For testing, you may try and use the unit codes listed in
		&quot;Testing with mock data&quot;; depending on the back end they may however not be
		available in the back-end customizing.
		Note: Although %, DEG, NO and M/L are valid, the back end does not accept them
		as they are no weight units; you see a corresponding error message
		"Invalid weight unit..." when saving a weight with one of these units upon leaving the
		weight input field.
		For a complete list of valid unit codes, see the &quot;ExternalCode&quot; property of the
		objects linked in "Unit Codes" in the test application.
		<h4>Test measures</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Check:</b> Weights in the table are displayed with the number of decimal places
				associated with the corresponding unit.</li>
			<li>Change the weight for a product in the table to "12.3 NO" and leave the input
				field.</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> The weight is formatted with the decimal places associated with
				the entered unit code to "12.30 NO".</li>
			<li>Change the weight to "21".</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> The weight is formatted with the decimal places associated with
				the previous unit code to "21.00 NO".</li>
			<li>Change the weight to "12.345 NO".</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> You see a validation error message "Enter a number with a maximum of 2
				decimal places" and the weight field shows an invalid data state.</li>
			<li>Change the weight unit to an invalid code such as 'XYZ'.</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> You see an error message and the weight field shows an invalid data
				state.</li>
			<li>Change the weight to "32".</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> The weight is formatted with the decimal places associated with
				the <b>last valid</b> unit code 'NO' to "32.00 NO".</li>
		</ul>
		Test the following with mock data only
		<ul>
			<li>Change the weight of the product 'Notebook New' which has no weight yet to "42".
			</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> The weight is formatted to "42" and the field has no invalid data
			state.</li>
			<li>Change the weight of the product 'Notebook New' to "KG".</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> You see an error message and the weight field shows an invalid data
				state.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Check whether currencies are handled properly regarding decimal places defined for the
			corresponding currency code</h3>
		<h4>Testing with mock data</h4>
		Invoke the test with "EUR3" which has 3 decimal places in case mock data is used.
		In addition, you may use the following valid currency codes for testing:
		<ul>
			<li> JPY (0 decimal places)</li>
			<li> EUR and USD (2 decimal places)</li>
			<li> BHD (3 decimal places)</li>
		</ul>
		For a complete list of valid currency codes, see the &quot;CurrencyCode&quot; property of
		the objects linked in "Currency Codes" in the test application.
		<h4>Testing with back end</h4>
		For testing, you may use the currency codes listed in &quot;Testing with mock data&quot;;
		depending on the back end they may however not be available in the back-end customizing.
		For a complete list of valid currency codes, see the &quot;CurrencyCode&quot; property of
		the objects linked in "Currency Codes" in the test application.
		<h4>Test currencies</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Check:</b> Prices in the table are displayed with the number of decimal places
				associated with the corresponding currency.</li>
			<li>Change the price for a product in the table to "12.3 USD" and leave the input
				field.</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> The price is formatted with the decimal places associated with
				the entered currency code to "12.30 USD".</li>
			<li>Change the price to "21".</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> The price is formatted with the decimal places associated with
				the previous currency code to "21.00 USD".</li>
			<li>Change the price to "12.345 USD".</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> You see a validation error message "Enter a number with a maximum of 2
				decimal places" and the price field shows an invalid data state.</li>
			<li>Change the currency to an invalid code such as 'XYZ'.</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> You see an error message and the price field shows an invalid data
				state.</li>
			<li>Change the price to "32".</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> The price is formatted with the decimal places associated with
				the <b>last valid</b> currency code 'USD' to "32.00 USD".</li>
			<li>Change the price to "42 $".</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> The price is formatted with the decimal places associated with
				the entered currency code to "42.00 USD".</li>
		</ul>
		Test the following with mock data only
		<ul>
			<li>Change the price of the product 'Notebook New' which has no price yet to "42".</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> The price is formatted to "42.00" and the field has no invalid data
			state.</li>
			<li>Change the price of the product 'Notebook New' to "EUR".</li>
			<li><b>Check:</b> You see an error message and the price field shows an invalid data
				state.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Test creation of a new entry</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>Enter a new entity in the 'New Entry' form. Set the product ID to '0123456789ABC'.
				Select the next input field.</li>

				disappears.</li>
