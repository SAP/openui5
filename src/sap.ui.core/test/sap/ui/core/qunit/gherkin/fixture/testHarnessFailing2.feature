@wip
Feature: An @wip feature automatically sets all its scenarios as @wip too

  This .feature file needs to be separate because it's @wip, and we can only have one "Feature:" per .feature file

  Scenario: Don't fail a test with no assertions, if its feature is @wip
    Given an @wip feature grows no moss
