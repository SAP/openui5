				Overview
			</h2>

			<p>
				Cards allow variety of options for user interaction. The whole card can be an interactive element (experimental), or,
				alternatively, the card can contain interactive elements - card header, links, buttons, list items, and others.
			</p>
			<h2>Whole Card Interaction (Experimental)</h2>
			<p>
				Clicking anywhere in the card can trigger an action, making the whole card interactive.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whole Card Interaction has specific requirements, related to accessibility standards: the card must have the role of
				"listitem" and it must be located within a "list." If the card is not designated as a "listitem," this type of
				interaction will not function properly.
			</p>
			<p>
				To achieve Whole Card Interaction the host environment can leverage one of the following options:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Using sap.f.GridContainer. In this case the role assignment and the rest of the accessibility requirements will be
					handled automatically. You can see <a data-demokit-href="#/entity/sap.f.GridContainer"
						target="_blank">sample</a>
					and find out more in the <a data-demokit-href="#/api/sap.f.GridContainer" target="_blank"> documentation</a> in Demo Kit.
				</li>
				<li>
					Custom layout - The host environment can create its own layout. Cards must be contained within an element with the role "list".
					Each card must have its property
					<code><a data-demokit-href="#/api/sap.f.CardBase%23controlProperties" target="_blank">semanticRole</a></code>
					set to <code>ListItem</code>.
					<br><b>Note:</b> The layout must have the role of "list" and should properly handle keyboard navigation and screen reader functionality.
					<div>
						<a class="try-button" href="../../index.html#/explore/htmlConsumption/customList" target="_parent">Try it Out</a>
					</div>
				</li>
				</p>
			</ul>
