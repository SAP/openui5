			<h2 id="cors">Card Fails to Load Data Due to CORS Issues</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Description:</b>
				Card, embedded in your hosting environment fails to load data, due to CORS error.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Root Cause:</b>
				If the card uses a remote URL, such as the publicly available Northwind OData service, the browser may
				refuse to connect to it.
				Due to the same-origin policy, browsers deny AJAX requests to service endpoints in case the service
				endpoint has a different domain/subdomain, protocol, or port than the app.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Resolution: </b>
				In this case the card should not request the data service directly, but should use destination instead.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Configure a destination in the card manifest (<a href="../../index.html#/learn/configuration/destinations" target="_parent">see card destinations</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Make sure that the host environment resolves the destination correctly (<a href="../../index.html#/integrate/destinations" target="_parent">see resolving destinations</a>)
					or that you have a <code>defaultUrl</code> in the manifest which works in your testing environment
				</li>
				<li>Check the request made (for example using the browser's Network tab) and ensure it is requesting the
					correct resource</li>
			</ol>

			<h2 id="webPageCardErrors">WebPage Card Fails to Load</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Description:</b>
				The content of a WebPage card doesn't show up. Instead, there is an error message, saying that the origin you have
				pointed to refused to connect.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Root Cause:</b>
				The <code>src</code> of the WebPage card is subject to the same-origin policy, which means that cross-origin request
				are restricted, in order to prevent security vulnerabilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Resolution: </b>
				In case <b>it does not violate security policies</b>, the server can enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for the origin
				where the card resides.
