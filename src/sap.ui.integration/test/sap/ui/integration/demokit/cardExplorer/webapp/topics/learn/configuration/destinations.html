			<h1 id="overview">Destinations</h1>
			<p>
				Destinations are used for outbound communication to a remote resource and contain the required
				connection information.
				They are represented by symbolic names that are used by the cloud application to refer to a remote
				connection.
				When a card is using SAP BTP destinations, those are configured in the manifest.
				Inside the manifest, the card developer indicates the name of the destination and the URL that
				depends on this destination.
			</p>
			<p>
				Inside the host environment, the host application developer creates a method that resolves a given
				destination name to an absolute URL. This happens with the help of the sap.ui.integration.Host element.
			</p>
			<p>
				For more information of SAP Business Technology Platform destinations, check our <a data-demokit-href="#/topic/3a16c7a2f1e944deb000db49e5ece6be" target="_blank">Create a Northwind Destination</a> example.
			</p>

			<h2 id="definingDestinations">Defining Destinations</h2>
			<p>
				In the <code>configuration</code> section of the card, under the <code>destinations</code> subsection, the card developer defines destinations.
				Each destination is identified by a unique key and its properties are configured in this part of the card settings.
			</p>

			<h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>

			<div class="tableWrapper">
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Property</th>
						<th>Type</th>
						<th>Required</th>
						<th>Default</th>
						<th>Description</th>
						<th>Schema Version</th>
						<th>Since</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>name</td>
						<td>string</td>
						<td>Yes</td>
						<td></td>
						<td>The name of the destination. This should be the same name that is used in the SAP Cloud
							Platform. The host environment is responsible to resolve that name to a URL.</td>
						<td>1.20.0</td>
						<td>1.76</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>defaultUrl</td>
						<td>string</td>
						<td>No</td>
						<td></td>
						<td>Default URL for the destination. If the destination can not be resolved by the host, this
							URL will be used.</td>

						<td>1.77</td>
					</tr>

			</div>

			<h2 id="usingDestinations">Using Destinations</h2>
			<p>
				Described destinations can be referenced by their key using the following specific syntax: <code>{{destinations.myDestinationKey}}</code> within <code>"sap.card"</code> namespace, but not within the definition of another destination.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, the same syntax can be used in the <code>Card#request()</code> method.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Note</b>: For Component cards a dedicated API is provided. For more information, see the
				<a href="../../../index.html#/explore/destinations/component" target="_parent">Component Card sample</a>.
			</p>

			<h2>Destinations in Child Cards</h2>
			<p>
				Cards opened by a <code>ShowCard</code> action (child cards) must not define the "configuration/destinations" section in their manifest.
				They automatically inherit the destinations from the main card.
			</p>

			<h2 id="inTheHostEnvironment">Resolving Destination Names</h2>
			<p>
				Each destination name should be resolved to an absolute URL by the host environment.
				For detailed information see <a href="../../../index.html#/integrate/destinations" target="_parent">Integrate Destinations</a>.
			</p>

			<h2 id="examples">Example</h2>

			<p>An example of a card that fetches data from Northwind destination:</p>
			<pre class="lang-json">
"sap.card": {

		<mark>"destinations": {
			"myDestination": {

		"parameters": {

				"value": 7,
				"type": "integer"
			}
		}
	},
	"data": {
		"request": {
			<mark>"url": "{{destinations.myDestination}}/Orders",</mark>
			"parameters": {
				"$format": "json",
				"$top": "{parameters>/maxItems/value}",
				"$orderby": "Freight desc"
			}
		}
