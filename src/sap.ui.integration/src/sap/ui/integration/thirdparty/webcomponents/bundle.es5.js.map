the <code>ui5-checkbox</code> ends where the text ends.\n * <br><br>\n * You can disable the <code>ui5-checkbox</code> by setting the <code>disabled</code> property to\n * <code>true</code>,\n * or

It consists of two parts: the date input field and the\n * date picker.\n *\n * <h3>Usage</h3>\n *\n * The user can enter a date by:\n * <ul>\n * <li>Using the calendar that opens in a popup</li>\n * <li>Typing it in directly in the input field</li>\n * </ul>\n * <br><br>\n * When the user makes an entry and chooses the enter key, the calendar shows the corresponding date.\n * When the user directly triggers the calendar display, the actual date is displayed.\n *\n * <h3>Formatting</h3>\n *\n * If a date is entered by typing it into\n * the input field, it must fit to the used date format.\n * <br><br>\n * Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation.\n * For more information, see <ui5-link target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table\" class=\"api-table-content-cell-link\">UTS #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup Language</ui5-link>.\n * <br><br>\n * For example, if the <code>format-pattern</code> is \"yyyy-MM-dd\",\n * a valid value string is \"2015-07-30\" and the same is displayed in the input.\n *\n * <h3>Keyboard Handling</h3>\n * The <code>ui5-datepicker</code> provides advanced keyboard handling.\n * If the <code>ui5-datepicker</code> is focused,\n * you can open or close the drop-down by pressing <code>F4</code>, <code>ALT+UP</code> or <code>ALT+DOWN</code> keys.\n * Once the drop-down is opened, you can use the <code>UP</code>, <code>DOWN</code>, <code>LEFT</code>, <code>right</code> arrow keys\n * to navigate through the dates and select one by pressing the <code>Space</code> or <code>Enter</code> keys. Moreover you can\n * use tab to reach the buttons for changing month and year.\n * <br>\n *\n * <h3>ES6 Module Import</h3>\n *\n * <code>import \"@ui5/webcomponents/dist/DatePicker\";</code>\n *\n *
