	<h2>Cookie Statement</h2>
	<p>This Cookie Statement was updated on January 28, 2025.</p>
	<p>This Cookie Statement describes how SAP (hereinafter also “We”, “Our”)
		uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and store information when
		you visit UI5 Demo Kit. SAP's Privacy Statement applies in
		addition to this Cookie Statement. SAP's Privacy Statement informs you
		about the way SAP uses, stores and protects personal data collected. It also
		informs you of your data protection rights and how to exercise them. We
		recommend that you read <a href="static/PrivacyStatement">UI5 Demokit's Privacy Statement</a></p>

	<h3>What are Cookies and similar technologies?</h3>
	<p>Cookies are small files placed on your device (computer, tablet or
		smartphone). When you access a website, a cookie is placed on your device
		and it will send information to the party that placed the cookie.
		There are other technologies performing a similar function to cookies. These
		include inter alia web beacons, clear gifs, and social plug-ins. These are
		often used in conjunction with cookies to help a website owner understand
		its users better.</p>

	<h3>What are first party Cookies?</h3>
	<p>SAP's websites contain first party Cookies. First party cookies are cookies that are specific to the website
		that created them. These cookies enable SAP to operate an efficient service and to track patterns of user
		behavior to
		SAP's website.</p>

	<h3>What are third party Cookies?</h3>
	<p>The difference between a first party cookie and a third party cookie relates to
		who places the cookie on your device. SAP sometimes allows third parties to
		place Cookies on your device. Third party cookies are placed on your device
		by a third party (i.e., not by SAP). While SAP allows third parties to access
		SAP's website to place a third-party cookie on your device, SAP does not
		retain control over the information supplied by the cookies, nor does SAP
		retain access to this information. This information is controlled wholly by that
		third party according to the respective privacy policy of the third party. For
		more information about these Cookies, please click the “Cookie Preferences”
		link in the footer of the webpage.</p>

	<h3>Analytics and Digital Marketing in the United States of America</h3>
	<p>In the United States SAP routinely works with third party analytics and digital
		marketing providers who facilitate and support SAP (and partner) marketing
		activities including targeted communications. These activities may involve
		the sharing of limited Personal Information (personal identifiers and contact
		information, your interests and interactions with SAP,
		professional/employment information) for those specific business purposes.
		In addition to the above, SAP may also share your personal data with other
		third parties, or for other business purposes, with your explicit consent.
		SAP endeavors to recognize common opt-out preference signals at a
		browser level, and frictionlessly exclude you from marketing cookies and
		associated tracking.</p>

	<h3>What cookies are used?</h3>
	<p>SAP wants you to be in a position to make an informed decision for or
		against the use of cookies which are not strictly necessary for technical
		features on [list your Web presence]. If you elect to reject cookies used for
		advertising, you will be shown advertising that is less targeted to your
		interests. This will still allow you to use all of the functionality of [list your
		Web presence].</p>
	<p>When tracking and evaluating the usage behavior of users of the Web
		Presence by means of cookies or similar technologies includes the processing of your personal data, SAP
		conducts the processing based on
		the following legal permissions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>GDPR Article 6.I (a) if it is necessary that We ask you for your
			consent to process your personal data,</li>
		<li>GDPR Article 6.I (b) if necessary to fulfill (pre-)contractual obligations
			with you,</li>
		<li>GDPR Article 6.I (f) if necessary to fulfill (pre-)contractual obligations
			with the company or other legal body you represent as a customer
			contact (legitimate interest to efficiently perform or manage SAP's
			business operation),</li>
		<li>or equivalent legal permissions under other relevant national laws,
			when applicable</li>
	</ul>
	<p>SAP differentiates between Required Cookies that are absolutely necessary
		to enable technical core functionalities, Functional Cookies that allow SAP to
		analyze the site usage, and Advertising Cookies that are used to serve ads
		relevant to your interests.</p>
