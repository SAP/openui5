What is it?
-----------
OpenUI5 lets you build enterprise-ready web applications, responsive to all devices, running on almost
any browser of your choice. It's based on JavaScript and follows web standards.
It eases your development with a client-side HTML5 rendering library including a rich set of controls
and supports data binding to different data models (JSON, XML and OData).

And... it's free and open source: OpenUI5 is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 - see [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt).
It also contains third-party open source modules. See the list and respective licenses in [THIRDPARTY.txt](THIRDPARTY.txt).
Third-party module license information is also available in machine-readable format in the [.reuse/dep5](.reuse/dep5) file.
