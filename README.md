[OpenUI5. Build Once. Run on any device.](http://openui5.org)

What is it?
-----------
OpenUI5 lets you build enterprise-ready web applications, responsive to all devices, running on almost
any browser of your choice. It's based on JavaScript, using jQuery as its foundation and follows web standards.
It eases your development with a client-side HTML5 rendering library including a rich set of controls
and supports data binding to different data models (JSON, XML and OData).

And... it's free and open source: OpenUI5 is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 - see [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt)

Try it!
-------
Check out our [interactive control playground](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/controls)
as well as a number of [sample applications](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/demoapps).

Get it!
-------
Go to the [download page](http://openui5.org/download.html) and get the complete UI5 runtime
and the UI5 SDK containing the documentation and many example apps as well as the complete runtime.

You can also consume OpenUI5 using the [UI5 Tooling](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/). **Get started [here](https://sap.github.io/ui5-tooling/pages/GettingStarted/)!**

Alternatively, you can also download [every OpenUI5 library](https://www.npmjs.com/org/openui5) individually via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm), for example: `npm install @openui5/sap.ui.core @openui5/sap.m @openui5/themelib_sap_belize [...]`.

Preload packages for components and libraries can be built using the [UI5 Tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling).

Hack it!
--------
You can get the sources and build UI5 on your own, please check the [documentation for the UI5 development setup](docs/developing.md). You might then want to understand how [control libraries are structured and controls are developed](docs/controllibraries.md).
Maybe there's a bug you could analyze and fix?
