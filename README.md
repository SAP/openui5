What is it?
-----------
OpenUI5 lets you build enterprise-ready web applications, responsive to all devices, running on almost
any browser of your choice. It’s based on JavaScript, using jQuery as its foundation and follows web standards.
It eases your development with a client-side HTML5 rendering library including a rich set of controls
and supports data binding to different data models (JSON, XML and OData).
