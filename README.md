OpenUI5
=======
[OpenUI5. Build Once. Run on any device.](http://sap.github.io/openui5/)

What is it?
----------- 
Open UI5 lets you build enterprise-ready web applications, responsive to all devices, running on almost any browser of your choice. It’s based on JavaScript, using JQuery as its foundation and follows web standards. It eases your development with a client-side HTML5 rendering library including a rich set of controls and supports data binding to different models (JSON, XML and OData).

Get it!
-------
It's free. Download the complete [UI5 Runtime](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/downloads/openui5-runtime-1.18.9.zip) or [UI5 Runtime Mobile](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/downloads/openui5-runtime-mobile-1.18.9.zip), the load optimized package for mobile deployment in hybrid containers and the [UI5 SDK](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/downloads/openui5-sdk-1.18.9.zip).

Try the [Hello World](http://sap.github.io/openui5/getstarted.html), read the [Developer Guide](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/guide/Documentation.html) and refer to the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.html).

What's next?
------------
On top of the regular download package updates, source files will be transferred into a github repository. We’ll offer build and assembly steps for e.g. CSS calculation and packaging soon. Once these are available contributions can be considered.

Please be patient... This is work in progress.
