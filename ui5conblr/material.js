In order to identify loans which might get defaulted, any banker would have to go through a large set of data and typical tools would allow simple analytics. Using our ALP a bank could first filter on customers with loans, save these as a cohort. Use this new set of customers and filter them on those who are paying lesser EMI, having lesser credit score & customers who have multiple loans, these will be a new cohort called, “Potential Defaulters”.

Overcoming the reliability and acceptance obstacles requires a developer-minded test framework that integrates with the development environment and provides immediate value. In this session we will show how those challenges are solved in the OPA testing framework, specially intended for UI5 based applications. By using insiders knowledge from the UI5 core, OPA provides an inherent reliability without any explicit efforts. An integrated backend mocking completes the toolset. Together, those features make it possible that every UI developer could build extensive, self-contained test suites that cover most UI interactions supported by the application.

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS.\n \nThe session will be an overview of how both these (SAPUI5 and D3) technologies can be combined to create simple yet intuitive visualization as SAPUI5 Custom Control to suit any out of the box business requirement. Excellent opportunity for the participants to get hands-on experience of both these latest technologies.\n\nAgenda:\n- SAPUI5 overview\n- Understanding UI5 controls\n- Learning how to build visualizations using D3\n- Wrapping the D3 visualization as a SAPUI5 custom control\n\n\n"},{title:"Building a Scalable Framework with SAPUI5",type:"",speaker:"Shiyazudeen A, Manjunath M",startTime:"17:00",endTime:"17:45",duration:45,abstract:"Merck has operations across 66 countries. We have about 350 thousand products. And all of this is supported by a robust ERP Application that is built over SAPUI5. We have built a custom application that can handle the entire landscape of ERP modules, from a single app.\n\nWe have built a highly customizable framework based on SAPUI5. Some of the key features are listed in the sections below:\n\n*Scalable*\nThe framework is built in such a way that it can accommodate adding modules, personas and entities are as simple as creating a label in your Gmail. All existing features of the framework such as filter, views, charts, etc are automatically applied to new additions. Any new enhancements to the framework are available by default across modules/personas.\n\n*Custom Personas*\nThe framework supports configurable personas. Building a new action is as simple as creating a simple configuration file, that would get translated into a new custom persona.\n\n*Advanced Filters*\nWhile using SAPUI5 to fetch data from HANA, natively it can just handle unidimensional data. We have created the capability to have advanced filters that would enable the user to handle multi-dimensional data. Users can save such filtered data as labels and share with others as well.\n\n*Custom UI5 applications hosted on the framework*\nWe have build custom solutions that are not natively available in SAP ERP, using SAPUI5. The framework helps reduce the complexity involved in integrating some of these solutions, by providing a unified platform to host these. Some of such solutions are: OCR based Invoice Processing, Social Media Collaboration, Document Explorer for Document Management Solutions, WIMS (Where Is My Stuff), Analytics Dashboards that can provide Combined Storyboards to the users.\n\n*Consistent User Experience*\nUsing UI5 guidelines, we have created a consistent user experience across modules like Finance, Sales, CRM, Procurement, EHS, Plant Maintenance and Quality Management to name a few. \n"},{title:"Use of annotations and XML View templating",type:"",speaker:"Rahul Inamadar",startTime:"17:55",endTime:"18:15",duration:20,abstract:"XML View template is the advanced part of SAPUI5. Also this is the cool way to generate views dynamically. Annotations plays key role in this. You can actually generate the view dynamically as template for different common use case. E.g. If you want provide the common UI solution which renders different fields dynamically based on your annotation structure. The annotation structure will come from back-end. Therefore there is possibility that you maintain some sort of customizing in back-end to create the annotation structure. Read the annotations in front end and create dynamic UI.\n\nThis solution provides basically to leverage the needs of different customer demands with single UI solution in UI5 way.
