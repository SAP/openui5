Example for defining a class
============================

Full example of a class, including JSDoc:

```js
// declare the module (also ensures existance of foo.bar)
jQuery.sap.declare("foo.bar.MyClass");

// declare and document the constructor function

/**
 * Some short sentence that summarizes the functionality of the class.
 *
 * A more detailed explanation of the class. Might consist of multiple sentences
 * and paragraphs. It is <i>possible</i> to use <code>XHTML</code> <b>markup</b>
 * but this should be used only rarely, as it makes the doclet harder to read
 * in the JS editor.
 *
 * Paragraphs that are separated by empty lines will be formatted as separate paragraphs
 * in the final JSDOC documentation. This makes the addition of <p> or <br/> tags
 * unenecessary.
 *
 * It is possible to reference members of this class (like {@link #ownMethod}) or even of
 * other classes (like {@link sap.ui.Object#destroy}). But be careful: in contrast to JavaDoc,
 * the signature (parameters) of a method must not be included with the @link tag, only the
 * name of the method (as !JavaScript has no method overloading).
 *
 * @class (mandatory) Marks the function as a constructor (defining a class). (Note: if only one token 
 *                  follows the @class tag, JSDOc3 assumes that this token is the name of the class. 
 *                  If more tokens follow, it assumes that this is a class documentation. so to be on 
 *                  the safe side, it is best to use @classdesc for a description and @class or 
 *                  @constructor just as a marker.)
 * @param {string} sId Documentation of constructor parameters.
 * @param {object} [mProperties=null] For optional parameters, the name is enclosed in quare brackets.
 *                  A default value can be appended with a '='.
 * @param {string} [mProperties.text] Even members of a configuration parameter can be configured.
 * @see (optional, multiple) Fully qualified HTTP links to external documentation are also possible.
 *
 * The following annotation below defines the visibility as public or private (default).  
 * Note: there MUST BE NO TEXT AFTER PUBLIC/PRIVATE. Not even in the next line. If anything, 
 * another tag must follow.
 * @public|@private
 * @author (optional, multiple) Multiple authors are possible,
 *                              order is significant (first named author is the default contact).
 * @since (optional) When the class/function has been introduced.
 * @extends sap.ui.base.Object Documents the inheritance relationship.
 * @alias foo.bar.MyClass (Mandatory when defining a class with extend).
 */
sap.ui.base.Object.extend("foo.bar.MyClass", /** @lends foo.bar.MyClass.prototype */ {

  constructor: function(sId, mProperties) {

    // init and document members here
    /**
     * The ID of a MyClass.
     *
     * @private
     */
    this.mId = sId || Utils.createGUID();
  },

  // now add further methods to that prototype
  /**
   * Again a summary in one sentence.
   *
   * More details can be documented, should the method be that complex.
   * @param {string} sMethod The same mechanism as above can be used to document the parameters.
   * @param {object} [oListener] An optional parameter. If empty, the <code>window</code> is used instead.
   * @experimental Since 1.24 Behavior might change.
   * @public
   */
  ownMethod: function(sMethod, oListener) {

    // ... impl
  },

  /**
   * A private method.
   *
   * Every member with a doc comment is included in the public JSDOC.
   * So we explicitly declare this as a private member:
   * 
   * Additionally, using an underscore prefix prevents this method
   * from beeing added to the public facade.
   *
   * @private
   */
  _myVeryPrivateMethod: function() {
  }

});
```

Virtual Methods
---------------

```js
/**
 * A 'virtual' method, that doesn't exist in this class but should be declared
 * in subclasses.
 * 
 * It is even possible to document things that aren't there. Only useful usecase is the 
 * documentation of abstract methods.
 * 
 * @name foo.bar.MyClass.prototype.abstractMethod
 * @function
 * @protected
 */
```
