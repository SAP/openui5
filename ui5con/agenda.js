The main challenge for an application test creator is to write a test that does not suffer from sporadic failures that dismiss its value as a testing tool. Together with all its enterprise qualities, OpenUI5 provides a state-of-the-art application testing framework called OPA. Using it, everyone can write application tests that synchronize with the state of the UI5 framework and provide inherent reliability without any explicit efforts from the test.
