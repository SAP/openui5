Modern JavaScript-centric frameworks like UI5 have made this even more complicated as the application UI is generated completely asynchronously by JavaScript code. The main challenge for an application test creator is to write a test that does not suffer from sporadic failures that dismiss its value as a testing tool. Together with all its enterprise qualities, OpenUI5 provides a state-of-the-art application testing framework called OPA. Using it, everyone can write application tests that synchronize with the state of the UI5 framework and provide inherent reliability without any explicit efforts from the test. Together with support for backend mocking provided from the MockServer one could build extensive, self-contained test suites that cover most UI interactions supported by the application.</p><p>In this session we will start from an existing UI5 application and build an OPA test for some of its UI interaction scenarios. We will cover all aspects of test setup, selecting and interacting with UI5 controls, execution and debugging. We will also touch some advanced topics like structuring the tests in page objects and journeys, custom matchers and interaction with composite controls.</p><p>As this session involves live coding, please make sure you have a local <i>or</i> remote development setup.
