OPA5 can be further combined with Gherkin which provides a framework to describe test scenarios in natural language. With OPA5 and Gherkin in place, the developer must close a gap: translate sentences from natural language into code that runs the OPA tests.</p><p>In this talk I show how to bypass this time-consuming activity, and have the developer's focus shifted toward writing the actual test specification in natural language rather than code.</p>"

If they have found the production hall of interest they can walk inside and have a look at the production equipment. For further investigation they can dive deeper and deeper. There are two modes of visualization available. The Free Flight and the Egoshooter mode.</p><p>Furthermore the users can jump into SAP PM transactions, into OpenText documents and other systems to get more information related to the selected equipment.</p><p>All this is achieved by using SAPUI5 and the sap.ui.vk library. Cause the standard library did not completely fulfill the users requirements in respect to usability we enhanced the vk library using some technologies and ideas from WebGL and Three.js</p><p>Come to Booth 2 from 2:00 PM to 2:40 PM and I will show you whats possible with UI5 in the field of 3D visualization.</p>",
