Added benefit is that I get to sit on a chair, instead of doing physical exercise. Already at a young age, I was tinkering with web-applications, and envisioned a world where the OS would just be a webserver and a browser, So naturally in 2005 I started as an ABAP programmer in the backend. I’m not sure how I came to that decision, all I know is that it payed off, and 3 years later I was building webapplications again. For some reason -possibly alcohol- SAP decided several years back to make me an SAPMentor. This year, I passed that title on to a slightly less deranged, but equally annoying smartass. (or was it equally deranged, but less annoying…) That gave me more time to work on my hobby projects. Which does not mean my projects are going any faster, or are getting any better. It just means I have more unfinished projects.",
