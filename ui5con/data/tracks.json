It's been done before, many many times.Except that,… well I've done it many times according to the SAP Standards and using the SMP SDK. It’s tedious, and comes at a cost.So I figured: I can improve this.</p><ul>  <li>First of all, if you're developing in openUI5, you don't always have an oData service in the backend. More often than not, you'll be limited to a JSON service. So the offline oData Plugin is not an option. More so since you need an SMP license and you might not be in an SAP environment.</li>  <li>Secondly, the SAP ERP data model is very ill-suited for data synchronizations. If you're not working on an SAP backend and you can still influence the data model, better do it right.</li>  <li>Thirdly, executing operations on UI5 models is cumbersome, since you need to access the entity using a path, pull the data out, call some function with the data, catch the result and move it back into the model-entity… Cumbersome…</li></ul><p>Bit by bit, we'll tackle each of these issues and introduce:</p><ul>  <li>Timesliced database</li>  <li>BusinessObjects (no, not businessObjects-analytics, but software represenations of a business object, as in OO)</li>  <li>BusinessObjectModel</li>  <li>Local DB</li>  <li>Synch-model</li></ul>",

We use several established elements of UI5 library but also developed own UI5 controls, mainly presented within the process designer. Here, the business logic of the application is created via Visual Scripting.</p><p>As most of our customers are SAP customers using OpenUI5 and SAPUI5 they of course prefer the SAP technology due to the trouble-free visualization of SAP-data for mobile devices.</p><p>So to say, we created a huge UI5 app creation machine with its UI based on OpenUI5.</p><p>We want to present our technology and custom UI5 controls to show the great variety of the UI framework and our own custom framework for process designing.</p><p>To get a brief overview, please visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcZCekNxPhk</p>"

			"abstract":"<p>Writing reliable application tests for web applications has never been easy. Modern JavaScript-centric frameworks like UI5 have made this even more complicated as the application UI is generated completely asynchronously by JavaScript code. The main challenge for an application test creator is to write a test that does not suffer from sporadic failures that dismiss its value as a testing tool. Together with all its enterprise qualities, OpenUI5 provides a state-of-the-art application testing framework called OPA. Using it, everyone can write application tests that synchronize with the state of the UI5 framework and provide inherent reliability without any explicit efforts from the test. Together with support for backend mocking provided from the MockServer one could build extensive, self-contained test suites that cover most UI interactions supported by the application.</p><p>In this session we will start from an existing UI5 application and build an OPA test for some of its UI interaction scenarios. We will cover all aspects of test setup, selecting and interacting with UI5 controls, execution and debugging. We will also touch some advanced topics like structuring the tests in page objects and journeys, custom matchers and interaction with composite controls.</p><p>As this session involves live coding, please make sure you have a local <i>or</i> remote development setup. For local development you will need: browser, Git client, nodejs (preferred v6.11.0 LTS). Or you can use SAP WebIDE by registering a SAP Cloud trial account at: https://cloudplatform.sap.com/try.html</p>"
